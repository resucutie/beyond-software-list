## Sections in need for contributions
[System resources > Consoles (Homebrew)](#consoles-homebrew) - Needs more guides  
[System resources -> iOS](#ios) - Needs more items and applications  
[Utilities -> Media Management -> File converter](#file-converter) - Needs more FFmpeg frontends  
[Privacy and Security](#privacy-and-security) - Needs more entires  
[Compatibility and Emulation](#compatibility-and-emulation) - Needs more emulators  

## Guidelines
###### NO-MARGIN-CHANGES
- All entries should contain programs where the user has total control over it and are virus-free. Preferably Free and Open Source applications
- Each entry should follow the following format:
    - Name of the produt as a link (`[Product](link)`)
    - Row of [custom icons](#custom-icons) showing the avaiable icons (if it contains) in the following order:
        - Web :c-chrome: :c-firefox:

- The sections should be sorted in alphabetic order. But that's not required for entries. Note that some will not follow that rule, like: [Compatibility and Emulation -> Consoles](#consoles)
- Entries with alternatives: If there's an alternative to a program, its entry should be put right next to the other with a breaking line, and not a new paragraph
- Merged entries: Cases where the applications are too similar in terms of popularity, features, platform and UX-wise. Should be avoided most times, instead prefering
