It is recommended to not use GitHub's built in editor, and to instead download the files locally using Git. We assume that you know the basics of [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git) and [contributing on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project).

## Sections in need for contributions
[System resources > Consoles (Homebrew)](#consoles-homebrew) - Needs more guides  
[System resources -> iOS](#ios) - Needs more items and applications  
[Utilities -> Media Management -> File converter](#file-converter) - Needs more FFmpeg frontends

## Guidelines
###### NO-MARGIN-CHANGES
- All entries should contain programs where the user has total control over it and are virus-free. Preferably Free and Open Source applications
- Each entry should follow the following format:
    - Name of the product as a link (`[Product](link)`)
    - Row of [custom icons](#custom-icons) showing the available icons (if it contains) in the following order:
        - Web :c-chrome: :c-firefox:
            - If available on all platforms: :c-web:
            - If it is available as a browser extension: :c-extension:
        - Desktop :c-windows: :c-macos: :c-linux:
            - If available on all platforms: :c-pc:

- The sections should be sorted in alphabetic order. But that's not required for entries. Note that some will not follow that rule
- Entries with alternatives: If there's an alternative to a program, its entry should be put right next to the other with a breaking line, and not a new paragraph
- Merged entries: Cases where the applications are too similar in terms of popularity, features, platform and UX-wise. Should be avoided most times, instead prefering
